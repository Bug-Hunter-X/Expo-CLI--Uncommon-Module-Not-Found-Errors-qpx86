# Expo CLI: Uncommon Module Not Found Errors

This repository demonstrates an uncommon cause of module not found errors in Expo CLI projects and provides a solution.

## The Problem

Sometimes, you may encounter a `Module not found` error in Expo even after installing the necessary packages. This is often due to incorrect linking, especially when using third-party libraries or native modules.

The `bug.js` file shows an example where a module is incorrectly used, leading to this error. The error may be subtle and not immediately apparent due to complex dependencies or build processes.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to fix the module error. This usually involves verifying the package installation, checking the import paths, and ensuring correct linking of native modules if applicable. Thoroughly review your package.json and ensure all dependencies are compatible with your Expo version.  Additional steps might involve cleaning the cache and reinstalling dependencies.
