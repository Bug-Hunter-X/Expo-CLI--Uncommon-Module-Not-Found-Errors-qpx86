The solution depends on the root cause.  Common solutions include:

1. **Verify Package Installation:** Double-check that the package is listed in your `package.json`. Run `expo install <package_name>` to install it if it's missing.
2. **Check Import Paths:** Ensure the import path in your code (`import ... from ...`) correctly points to the location of the module. Relative paths are generally recommended.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, the Expo cache gets corrupted. Try these steps:
   - `expo prebuild`
   - `expo start --clear`
   - Delete the `.expo` folder and `node_modules` folder, then run `expo install` again. 
4. **Native Modules (if applicable):**  If the module involves native code, carefully review its installation instructions, which may involve additional linking steps.
5. **Expo SDK Compatibility:** Ensure that the package is compatible with your Expo SDK version.  Check the package's documentation or npm page for compatibility details.
6. **Dependency Conflicts:**  Check for conflicting versions of packages using tools like `npm-check` or `npm-dedupe`.

Example of corrected import (bugSolution.js):

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'; // Correct import
// ... rest of your component
```

Remember to replace `<package_name>` with the actual name of the package causing the issue.
